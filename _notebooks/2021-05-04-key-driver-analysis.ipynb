    "### Using Generalized Linear Models (GLMs)\n",
    "In general when we build GLM's it's often observed that the coefficients are negative, however, in the case of key driver analysis this is an indication of a problem.\n",
    "The causes could be:\n",
    "1. The sign is wrong\n",
    "    * The predictor variable is highly correlated with other predictors\n",
    "    * The predictor is unimportant\n",
    "2. The predictor variable encoded incorrectly\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Downsides of using GLM's for Key Driver Analysis:\n",
    "1. GLMs become highly unreliable when the predictors are highly correlated (multi-collinearity) and tend to pick up random patterns in the data, hence the possibility of incorrect signs.\n",
    "2. GLMs implicitly assume that predictors are on the same scale. So, it become hard to compare the coefficients directly. The most popular way to solve this problem is to divide the each value of predictor by it's standard deviation (i.e., to normalize or standardize the variables) but it does not necessarily solve the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "The solution to the above 2 problems is to not use GLMs ðŸ˜Š, and to instead use models that are more reliable when there are high correlations and can handle feature that are on different scales, such as **Shapley regression** and **Johnsonâ€™s relative weights**. These techniques do not solve the problem of correlated predictors. Rather, they ensure that you get stable results in the presence of correlated predictors. At a conceptual level, the way they do this is by computing importance scores as a weighted average of predictors, where the weights are determined by the extent of intercorrelation between the predictors."

    "### Using Shapley regression or Johnsonâ€™s relative weights\n",
    "As it's mentioned earlier, the traditional GLMs suffer from two practical challenges: sensitivity to high correlations between predictor variables, and, sensitivity to the scale of the predictor variables. Both problems can be addressed by using either Shapley regression or Johnsonâ€™s relative weights.\n",

    "The underlying math of both Shapley regression and Johnsonâ€™s relative weight ensures that both techniques always report a positive importance score."

    "## Finally, which method is recommended to perform Key Driver Analysis?\n",
    "Both Shapley regression and Johnsonâ€™s relative weights are designed to address the same two problems: correlations between predictor variables and predictor variables with different scales.\n",

    "The underlying theory of the two methods are completely different. \n",
